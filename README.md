AI-Driven Bitcoin Trading Strategy Using Machine Learning & Time Series Models
Project Overview

This project implements machine learning (ML) and statistical models to develop and evaluate trading strategies for Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The primary goal is to determine whether ML-based models outperform a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

The backtesting framework uses historical price data and incorporates various technical indicators to make trading decisions. Performance is then evaluated using key financial metrics.
üöÄ Features & Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing

    Historical Bitcoin price data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.
    Data is cleaned and transformed by computing log returns and handling missing values.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

To improve model performance, the following technical indicators are calculated:

    Simple Moving Averages (SMA 10 & SMA 50) ‚Äì Trend detection.
    Relative Strength Index (RSI) ‚Äì Overbought/oversold signals.
    MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) ‚Äì Momentum-based trend following.
    Average True Range (ATR) ‚Äì Volatility measure.
    Rolling Standard Deviation (Volatility) ‚Äì Price fluctuation tracking.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Models

Three different models are used to generate trading signals:

    Random Forest (RF) ‚Äì A decision-tree-based ensemble method that classifies trends.
    XGBoost (XGB) ‚Äì A gradient-boosting framework that optimizes trading signals.
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) ‚Äì A deep learning model for time series forecasting.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Backtesting the Strategy

Each model produces Buy (1) or Sell (0) signals, which are applied to historical BTC price data. Performance is compared to:

    Buy-and-Hold Benchmark ‚Äì A passive investment strategy.
    Statistical Model (APARCH) ‚Äì A time-series model for volatility adjustment.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Evaluation

Each strategy is assessed using financial metrics:

    Sharpe Ratio ‚Äì Risk-adjusted return.
    Max Drawdown ‚Äì Maximum loss from peak to trough.
    Win Rate ‚Äì Percentage of profitable trades.
    Annualized Volatility ‚Äì Risk measure.
    Cumulative Return ‚Äì Final portfolio growth.
